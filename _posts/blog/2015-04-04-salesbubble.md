excerpt: Live sales chat with Facebook-style chat head bubbles
---

SalesBubble will be an open source live sales chat system built with node.js, express and socket.io which looks like the Facebook Messenger chat heads that you get on mobile (bubbles). It was written for the front-end of MinuteHost to answer questions to customers who might be interested (sales). Because of this, it will support multiple representatives and unlimited users, default company profiles and configuration of everything like appearance, layout and language.
