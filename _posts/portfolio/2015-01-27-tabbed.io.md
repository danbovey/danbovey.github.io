Tabbed.io is a Google Chrome extension which replaces your new tab page with a minimalistic and clean dashboard featuring a clock and the date.

Each day you receive a new random wallpaper from [unsplash.com](http://unsplash.com)! It's built using jQuery and runs offline thanks to localStorage keeping track of the latest wallpaper you've used and all of your preferences.

* Randomise the wallpaper with a button
* Time and date settings
* Countdown timer
* Google search
* Add your own custom wallpaper
