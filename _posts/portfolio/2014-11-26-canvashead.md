A canvas game I made for a module called Programming with HTML APIs on my Web Development course. Based on the flash game Boxhead 2, I was inspired to create a zombie shoot ‘em up in HTML5 canvas using pure javascript. The purpose of the game is to survive the exponential waves of zombies that attack you. The score is counted by kills multiplied by a combo that increases with every kill.

In the second part of the module I made CanvasHead into a multiplayer game using node.js with WebSockets and support for player avatars using the Flickr API.
