The Web Project module for my second year of my Web Development degree put me in a group tasked with creating a website for a business called [Sidereal](http://sidereal-gem.com), a jewellery company from Cheshire. They craft bespoke and personalised jewellery for customers and wanted to re-design their website to convert more visitors into customers.

Each member of the group provided a draft design, and [mine was used for the foundation](/uploads/portfolio/sidereal/psd.jpg) of the final design. I was in the programming team, tasked with creating an order system that extends WooCommerce to handle requests from customers that would have a unique price, and support back-and-forth communication with images between customer and designer.

This was delivered within a few months, with the front and back-end coming together into a full e-commerce WordPress site.
