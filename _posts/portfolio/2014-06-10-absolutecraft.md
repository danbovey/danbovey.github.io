AbsoluteCraft is a game server that me and a friend run for the popular PC game Minecraft! The website is a feature-rich PHP system which runs on Laravel. It has an authentication system which allows users to register and login to edit their player profile, collect tokens, view stats or stay up to date with the community.

The previous website ran on a CMS called Enjin which was very restrictive, so the priority for this re-design was a future-proof back end that can change easily. For instance, if another server is created.

The outcome of this was a powerful dashboard which comes with user management, private messages, server management and site content management.
